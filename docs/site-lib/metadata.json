Voting Algorithm","icon":"","description":"Leetcode problem at <a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/\" target=\"_self\">https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/</a>Moore's Voting Algorithm, also known as Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is used to find a majority element in an array with frequency more than half of the size of the array.Here is a sample array of numbers in which we have to find the majority element.2 5 6 6 2 4 5 5 5 5 5As is obvious here, 5 is the majority element here. Here is the explanation and dry run of the algorithmWe start of by creating 2 variables called majority and count.To start with, we initialize count to 0 and set majority as the first element.\ncount=0, majority=2\nNow we iterate over the element, every time we encounter an element which is equal to the majority element, we increment the count. Every time we encounter an element which is not equal to the majority element, we decrement the count. When we are at an element and the count is zero, we set that element as the majority element and increment the count to 1.\nAt the end of the iteration, the number assigned to majority is our majority element.\nThis algorithm works because majority element occurs more than half of the time. So it will be able to counter all the other elements which may have been assigned to majority and triumph at the end.\nA dry run follows 2 5 6 6 2 4 5 5 5 5 5 Step 1 :\ncount=0, majority=None Step 2:\nIterating over 2\ncount=1, majority=2 Step 3:\nIterating over 5\n5 is not equal to 2, so we reduce the count\ncount =0, majority=2 Step 4:\nIterating over 6\ncount is zero. count=1, majority=6 Step 5:\nIterating over 6\ncount=2, majority=6 Step 6:\nIterating over 2\ncount=1, majority=6 Step 7:\nIterating over 4\ncount=0, majority=6 Step 8:\nIterating over 5\nSince count is 0, we set majority to 5 and increment the count\ncount=1, majority=5 Now all the subsequent steps will just increment the count until we reach the end of the array. At the end 5 will be the majority element.

Parvatha Trek","icon":"","description":"I had not trekked for a few months and was badly missing the jungles. So on the weekend of 7-9 Nov 2025, I decided to go on a trek to Kumara Parvatha. Kumara Parvatha, also referred to as KP is widely known as the most difficult trek in Karnataka. While this fame is associated with the route from Kukke, the route we took was a bit different.KP can be reached by 2 routes. One of the routes starts from Kukke town right behind the famous Kukke Subramanya temple. This trail is difficult and covers a distance of 14 kms one way. Most of it is steep climb over rocky sections. This is the route which earns this trek the title of the most difficult trek of South India. I had trekked via this path thrice earlier.The other route starts from Bidehalli forest checkpost in Somwarapete. I had never been from this side. This trail is relatively easier compared to the Kukke one and one has to cover just 7km to reach the peak. The trail passes through forests with mostly flat or gradual climb. There are a couple of rocky patches that are steep.I went on this trek with Plan The Unplanned (PTU). We did a circuit trek starting from Bidehalli and ending at Kukke. I generally do not capture photos while on the trail. But on this trek, for a change, I captured a few pics and I will be putting some of them here.We started our journey from Bangalore on the night of Friday. We reached our homestay early on Saturday. We got a bit delayed in freshening up and having breakfast and I don't really remember when we left from our homestay. We got in the bus and the bus drove us up to the beginning of the trailhead. From here, we had to walk another km to reach Bidehalli forest office. Most of this walk was on flat ground with a bit of incline up and down.This was the first pic I captured. Some cloud covered peaks are visible at a distance<img alt=\"View from the trail\" src=\"travel/kp/attachments/firstview-1.jpg\" target=\"_self\">This is how the trail looked like.<br>\n<img alt=\"Trail\" src=\"travel/kp/attachments/trail.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Approaching the forest office. The roof visible in the pic is the forest office. This is where the trek actually starts<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108082745.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We got our permits and bags checked and started the trek. We were a group of 20 trekkers accompanied by 2 trek leads and 2 local guides. The trail starting from the forest office crosses over a wide stream which is spanned by a hanging bridge. The bridge shakes while one walks on it, adding another sense of adventure to the experience.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108085305.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The trail is like any other trail in the western ghats and I quickly felt at home within the dense forest.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/denseforest.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We kept walking inside the forest for quite some time. Finally we emerged from the forest to be greeted with the first view of nearby valley and peaks. The weather wasn't too good and the hazy conditions did not let us get a good view of the peaks. Since other people from our group were far behind, I spent a few minutes sitting here and enjoying the view.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/viewpoint1.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The trail entered forest again and we were greeted with interesting trees all around us. There also was a copious growth of a specific plant which I have seen all over the western ghats in Karnataka and Maharashtra. It has leaves which cause itching if rubbed against the skin. I do not know what it is called and need to find it out.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/itch.jpg\" target=\"_self\">There also was a dense growth of bamboo alongside the trail<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/bamboo.jpg\" target=\"_self\">An interesting flower<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108104450.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Another view of the peaks visible from the trail<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108104530.jpg\" target=\"_self\">As we neared the peak, the trail became rocky with most of the rocks and trees covered with moss. I could not help noticing that this was very similar to the trail on the other side of the peak as one approaches from the Kukke side.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110721.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110734.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110747.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Some more wildflowers<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108113345.jpg\" target=\"_self\">This specific section of the forest reminded me of the forests in Harry Potter. When I posted this on Instagram, someone also pointed out that a root on the ground looks like a snake.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114201.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Some new leaves sprouting out of a tree.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114559.jpg\" target=\"_self\">A stump of a tree whose upper part has fallen.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114830.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Nearing the peak. The peak visible in the background is not where we are headed. Its another peak and locals say that no one has ever returned from that peak. <br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108115554.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We reached the peak and people spread all around. I spent some time photographing the wild flowers around me<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108120858.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108120907.jpg\" target=\"_self\">There was a kid who was carrying a bouquet of flowers. Thinking it to be her creation, I complemented here. She said that some trekker had gifted it to her and she was ready to gift it to me. I just took a pic and returned it back to her.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108122259.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Greenery all around on the peak.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108122605.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Some more wildflowers<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108123423.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108123429.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124534.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We spent quite some time roaming around the peak exploring different viewpoints. There are no clear trails here and we had to wade through shrubs and grasses. We had our local guides and trek leads for guidance. These viewpoints gave us a great show of the hide and seek between mountain peaks and clouds. Here are a few pics<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124014.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124853.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124933.jpg\" target=\"_self\">It was time to turn back. While descending from the peak, I cam across scat of some animal which I was not sure of. I need to show it to someone who can identify it. Here is a pic of it with my goggles as reference for the size.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132233.jpg\" target=\"_self\">I came across a mountain with an interesting rock formation hanging from its side.<br>\n<img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132852.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Hide and seek continues<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132919.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108135301.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The forest section between KP and Sesha Parcatha has to be one of the best sections of this trek. When you are walking alone here, it feels very peaceful.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108134600.jpg\" target=\"_self\">On reaching Sesha Parvatha, the clouds cleared for a bit and we were able to get some good views of the valley below us.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108142539.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We continued the trek further down and decided to take a break at Kallu Mantapa. We also had to refill our water bottles a short distance below this point. I clicked a few pics of the grasslands around me and dense forest visible at a distance from where I was sitting.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155026.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155030.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155055.jpg\" target=\"_self\">We kept walking and made for the forest office at Girigadde. By this time it was already late in the evening and we knew that it would be late in the night by the time we finished the trek. A couple of people in our groups were injured and 3 of us decided to stay back with them. I came across this tiny pond just before we were about to reach the forest office.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108171616.jpg\" target=\"_self\">Earlier, camping used to be allowed at Girigadde forest office and I have camped there twice. I remember spending most of my time during those times sitting on a bench and admiring the valley all around me. This time, we did not have enough time to do so, but I still went to the bench just to refresh my memories. The camping ground where I had camped on my previous visits was empty.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175328.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The views all around this viewpoint are a treat to the eyes.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175243.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175345.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175352.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175358.jpg\" target=\"_self\"><br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108180403.jpg\" target=\"_self\">The trek after this became challenging. The people who were injured found every step difficult to take. We had to help them a bit. We lied to them all throughout the trek, telling them that we were almost at the end of the trek. Finally we reached the exit check post at Kukke a few minutes before 10pm. We got in the bus and reached our homestay after midnight. Just as I was getting out of the trail, I saw this frog sitting in the middle of the path and took a pic.<br><img src=\"travel/kp/attachments/img20251108214253.jpg\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Routes to the peak","level":2,"id":"Routes_to_the_peak_0"},{"heading":"The Journey and the trek","level":2,"id":"The_Journey_and_the_trek_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"travel/kp/kumara-parvatha-trek.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":["travel/kp/attachments/firstview-1.html","travel/kp/attachments/trail.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108082745.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108085305.html","travel/kp/attachments/denseforest.html","travel/kp/attachments/viewpoint1.html","travel/kp/attachments/itch.html","travel/kp/attachments/bamboo.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108104450.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108104530.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110721.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110734.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108110747.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108113345.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114201.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114559.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108114830.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108115554.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108120858.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108120907.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108122259.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108122605.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108123423.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108123429.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124534.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124014.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124853.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108124933.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132233.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132852.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108132919.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108135301.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108134600.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108142539.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155026.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155030.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108155055.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108171616.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175328.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175243.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175345.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175352.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108175358.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108180403.html","travel/kp/attachments/img20251108214253.html"],"createdTime":1763305574977,"modifiedTime":1763308159329,"sourceSize":8831,"sourcePath":"travel/KP/Kumara Parvatha Trek.md","exportPath":"travel/kp/kumara-parvatha-trek.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":["travel.html"],"type":"markdown"},"index.html":{"title":"index","icon":"","description":"I will use this space to dump random write ups.
